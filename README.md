Example Team Profile WebPage created by this application:
![team-profile](./utils/images/)

## Installation
To install the Team Profile Generator application complete the following steps:
1. Clone the application's code from this [GitHub](https://github.com/sm3131/team-profile-generator) repository onto your local machine into a new directory (e.g. team-profile-generator).
2. Open the command line and navigate to the directory you cloned this repository into, then open the content in a code text editor. You should now see the main files and folders for this project (index.js, generateHTML.js, /lib, /dist, __tests__).
3. Next check to see if you have node.js installed on your machine by running the command *node -v* in your command line.
4. If you have node.js make sure your version is up to date by going to this website (https://nodejs.org/en/).
5. If you do not have node.js installed follow the installation steps on this website (https://nodejs.org/en/).
6. Once you have node.js installed, make sure you are still in the team profile generator directory in the command line, and then run the following command *npm install* to install the required packages and dependencies to run the application.
7. After you have node.js and the required npm dependencies installed, you are ready to run the application via node.js using the command line.

## Usage
To use the team profile generator application complete the following steps:
1. The purpose of this application is to generate a team profile webpage based on user input, so if you need of a nicely formatted team roster for your company this is the application for you. 
2. After you have completed all of the above installation steps, you can now either test the application to see how it works and what the prompts ask, or you can jump right into creating your team profile.
3. To begin running the application in the command line, type *node index.js* and this will start the program.
4. If the program is running properly you should be confronted with some initial intro text and the first user prompt asking if you would like to start creating your team profile.
5. The application will then ask for you to start by entering the team manager's information (i.e. confirm role, name, id, email, office number) 

6. After completing the manager prompts the app will ask if you would like to add another team member (i.e. engineer or intern), or if you would like to finish building your team
7. If you select engineer or intern, you will be confronted with more user prompts asking about that team member's information (i.e. confirm role, name, id, email, github, school), then you will again be asked if you would like to add another team member or finish building the team profile
8. If you select finish building team then this will collect all of your user input and create the appropriate html and css to generate your team profile webpage. You should see a message that reads, "Team Profile WebPage Created!", after seeing this message you can return to your code editor and you will see a new file has been created titled, "new_index.html". If you open this file in your browser you will see the finalized team profile that has been generated.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Each time you run the program and fill out the user prompts for your team members, you will overwrite the existing new_index.html file if one currently exists. Filling out the user prompts multiple times will not create multiple new_index.html files instead it will overwrite the existing new_index.html file. It is recommended that you copy and save the new_index.html file you created before generating a new one, that way you will not lose your current team profile webpage.

## Credits

All of the code and tests for this project were written by myself, Sammi Moore. I wrote the tests for each of the classes used in this application, I wrote the code that is run in the node.js environment, and I wrote the code required to generate the html and css for the finalized team profile webpage. 

The resources that I used for this project are as follows:
- Icons for each of the employee cards were from Font Awesome ()
- Bootstrap styling for the webpage design and format was created using ()
- The inquirer package from npm in this node.js application in order to generate user prompt questions (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
- The Jest package from npm to run tests for my code in node.js ()
